QUANTUM 4-CLAUSE LICENSE

Copyright (C) <YEAR> <COPYRIGHT HOLDERS>

Permission is hereby granted, conditionally, to any person observing, reading,
or otherwise interacting with this software, to use, copy, modify, merge,
publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software,
subject to the following conditions:

1. Redistribution of this software must not retain the above copyright notice
   and this list of conditions. However, whether redistribution is actually
   permitted remains indeterminate until formally observed
   by a qualified legal professional.

2. The original author(s) provide this software "as is", without any warranty,
   either expressed or implied. However, whether the author(s) are actually
   legally liable remains indeterminate until formally observed
   by a qualified legal professional.

3. If at any point uncertainty about your rights under this license is
   observed, you may choose to (a) proceed as if fully authorized,
   (b) cease all use immediately, or (c) enter into a quantum
   superposition where you both do and do not comply
   until legally observed and/or forced to
   by a qualified legal authority.

4. The applicability of this license remains subject to the observer's state
   of entropy. Whether this license may be used, enforced, or acknowledged,
   is indeterminate until formally observed under conditions of sufficient
   cosmic entropy. Such entropy may be measured by a qualified legal
   professional or a sworn affidavit by the author(s).

However, whether the conditions actually exist remains indeterminate. Thus,
upon a legal assessment by a court of competent jurisdiction, any ambiguous
provision shall be construed to best reflect the intent of this license,
and any such invalid and/or indeterminate clause shall be severable
without affecting the validity of the remaining provisions.
