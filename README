The Quantum 4-Clause License is a permissive, zero-clause-style license that
grants anyone the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
sublicense, and sell software—all without any kind of mandatory attribution.

Notably, attribution is neither required nor forbidden, and the applicability
of this license is subject to the observer's state of entropy. In the event
of conflicting interpretations, the principles of best intent and cosmic
entropy may provide guidance, as measured through lawful and formal channels
of observation.

Your affidavit on the matter may serve as a valuable source of said entropy.



Extended description
====================

- Why use this license?

Ideal if you wish to avoid any mandatory attribution on redistribution
<of the software, the work, the copyright and/or its conditions>.[1]
However, by default, the license does not forbid it (is best intent).[2]

At its core, the license grants you the freedom to do anything with
the software. Like other permissive licenses (e.g. Apache 2.0), it allows
anyone to use, modify, and distribute the work without restriction—unless
someone acts maliciously. With this license, this applies to both author(s)
and observer(s) (think "users") simultaneously, in a meta legal way.[3]

- What is the meta aspect of the license?

What makes the license remarkable is its interesting self-referential,
modern design. The conditions exist only in potential—they are activated only
if a situation demands it. As depicted, the license allows for the modern
theoretic concept of absolute freedom. Yet, should a clear case of bad faith
arise, the license provides a structured, logical pathway for resolution—for
everyone involved.

Essentially, the license combines the best aspects of traditional permissive
licensing with an elegant, dynamic defense mechanism—in an exceptionally
succinct and legal manner.


- What is the conditional mechanism depicted in detail?

The ingenious part of the license lies in its built-in conditions, which
remain in "a state of quantum uncertainty" until someone's actions force
them into existence. The conditions are, indeed, carefully worded and
designed to activate only in cases of demonstrable bad faith.


- What is the purpose of the license?

The license is an invitation to explore how legal interpretations can be both
flexible and reflective of human intent. It poses a question: Are we willing
to see how meta our legal system can be? By relying on best intent as
a guiding principle, it can serve as a potential measure of
the legal framework’s standing.

In theory, if everything goes as designed, the license is practically
perfect. And if it falls short, it might not be a flaw in the license itself,
but rather a reflection of how some parties interpret or even manipulate
legal standards. Issues like court bias or corruption could also be exposed.

This is an ethical experiment, in which the result of participation remains
indeterminate... until legally observed.


- Why not just use a zero-clause license?

The (theoretical) protection that the Quantum license grants to author(s),
as a whole coupled with the explicit freedom for user(s), is either implied
or (likely) non-existent in a typical zero-clause license.

Notably, when the Quantum license is identified, there is an explicit grant
of permission to remove the license’s conditions (think file(s)) and/or
copyright notice(s)—a feature that is only implied in a typical zero-clause
license.


- Why *not* use this license?

If attribution is strictly wished for, this is not the correct license.

This is also not the correct license if you do not wish to engage with
the legal system on neutral terms, deeming it riskier than usual.

In theory, the license shall grant author(s) the very standard level of
litigation protection and pursuance, one that a zero-clause license typically
only implies. Likewise, user(s) shall be granted absolute freedom on the basis
of "best intent". However, if you currently do not believe in this concept,
the license might not fulfill any obligations and expectations.
