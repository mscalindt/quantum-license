The Quantum 4-Clause License is a permissive, zero-clause-style license that
grants anyone the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
sublicense, and sell softwareâ€”all without any kind of mandatory attribution.

Notably, attribution is neither required nor forbidden, and the applicability
of this license is subject to the observer's state of entropy. In the event
of conflicting interpretations, the principles of best intent and cosmic
entropy may provide guidance, as measured through lawful and formal channels
of observation.

Your affidavit on the matter may serve as a valuable source of said entropy.
